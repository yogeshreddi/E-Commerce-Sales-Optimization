# E-Commerce-Sales-Optimization

### Story Line:
-We are in the middle of paradigm shift; where technology has evolved a long way. Days have       gone by when people use to walk to the nearest store to get their required goods/services; now world’s population is more depending on e-commerce for selling/buying goods/services. As more and more population is transmuting to e-commerce/technology for their needs, more and more e-commerce companies are evolving every day. To sustain the competition in this fast growing field of revenue; there is a need for analyzing customer behavior.
	 In this project we analyzed customer traffic over different websites of an e-commerce company to understand customer behavior. Then we suggested the client how they can optimize their platform to improve sales.

### Data:
-The analysis depends on various parameters such as the customer visits, access platform, orders, bounce rate, adding to cart rate, product & search page views.

### Audience:
-Company’s board of members, sales and marketing team.

### Recommendations: 
-The Company was not allowing unregistered users to order though it was allowing them to add to cart the item. Rather, company should allow a guest checkout to improve their sales.
-There were couple of sites which were actually with very high bounce rate (Customer exits the site after looking at the first page), we suggested company that this could be an issue because of poor User Interface design. To improve these sites performance they could replicate the UI similar to other sites with low bounce rate.
